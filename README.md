# Welcome to company-commit-script ðŸ‘‹

> Typically we have multiple GitHub accounts. In most cases, there will be separate company accounts and personal accounts. As we spend a lot of time and work at the company, our efforts are not expressed in our personal accounts. So I created a script so that the company history can be left on my personal account.

## Install

```sh
mv script/post-commit (your_project)/.git/hooks/
chmod +x (your_project)/.git/hooks/post-commit
```
